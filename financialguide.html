                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>This guide is primarily focused on what to do with the budget you’ve allocated toward paying off
                    debts or saving toward some goal (e.g., a car or house). Why and what you should be prioritizing,
                    accounts to be investing in, investment options, how to get financial advice, etc.</p>

                <div class="read-more-content" id="preface-content">
                    <p>I do not discuss how much you should allocate toward this budget since it is very
                        situation-dependent. Creating and managing a budget is important, but outside the scope of this
                        guide, but here is a helpful resource if you need guidance. This guide also does not go into
                        some topics (e.g., how taxes work), but I’ll make additions if there is enough interest.</p>
                    <p>No recommendations or endorsements of any specific investment are given. I will be discussing
                        types of investments (e.g., GICs), example options, pros and cons, best practices, and in what
                        situations you would want to choose one over the other (based on time horizon, risk tolerance,
                        etc.). However, I will be sharing what I personally do since I think it is only fair for you to
                        hear what I am doing when it is my “neck on the line”. All details and figures are accurate as
                        of the time of writing but may change in the future.</p>
                    <p>Always open to hearing any suggestions or feedback, and answering any questions :)</p>
                    <p>I wasn’t sure how to make some sections entertaining, so you get cat memes. I wish y’all the best
                        in your financial journey! Yes, I like brackets too much.</p>

            <section id="why-investing">
                <h3>Why is Investing Important?</h3>
                <p>Perhaps you’re saving for a new car or a downpayment on a house, investing is a crucial tool to
                    achieve your long-term financial goals and security. Investing puts your money to work which would
                    otherwise be sitting around losing value due to inflation.</p>
                <p>However, you don’t need money to start investing, the best investment you can ever make is in
                    yourself and your own financial literacy (which you are doing right now)! It is one of the best
                    things you can do to set yourself up for success.</p>
                <p>As an example, there are two people with the goal of saving up for a downpayment for a home: Florence
                    and Eva. Florence had larger priorities so she wasn’t able to invest as early, but she is able to
                    put more money (monthly) towards investing when she does begin. Florence invests $2000/mo for 10
                    years and Eva invests $1000/mo for 20 years (equal total personal investments of $240,000). Both are
                    investing in growth ETFs and get 6% annual returns.</p>
                <p>Florence saved up $326,529 ($86,529 of which is interest).</p>
                <img src="florence_graph.jpg" alt="Florence Graph">
                <p>Eva saved up $455,646 ($215,646 of which is interest).</p>
                <img src="eva_graph.jpg" alt="Eva Graph">
                <p>Eva ends up with ~40% more for a downpayment! A huge difference despite both personally investing
                    $240,000 each. Florence would have to invest ~$2800/mo instead of $2000/mo to have the same
                    downpayment saved as Eva. Both scenarios are far better than not investing, you’d have to save
                    ~$3800/mo for 10 years to achieve the same downpayment as Eva if you left it in a chequing account
                    (and it would be losing value due to inflation!).</p>
                <p>This is just a hypothetical to illustrate the power of compound interest, investing early and with
                    the long term in mind. The longer you let the snowball roll, the faster it’ll grow! Investing
                    earlier, however, is not always an option, life might get in the way, or your investment timeline
                    could change (e.g., your car breaks down). If you’d like to test some investment timelines and
                    contributions you can play with this investment calculator. A conservative assumption for the return
                    rate of a diversified equity-based (stock market) portfolio is 5% (after inflation). Investing
                    regularly and early is important, but it is never too late to start; the best time to start was
                    yesterday, but the second best time is today!</p>
                <p>Compound interest sounds so important, but I’m in debt, should I hold off paying down debt to invest?
                    Compound interest works both ways, be sure to pay off any high-interest debt before investing! You
                    can think of paying off debt as a guaranteed return on investment, e.g., let's say you have a
                    $20,000 loan at 7% (for a car or renovation). Paying off the loan is a guaranteed 7% return on
                    investment. It is not a waste to prioritize debt over investing.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: Debt</h2>
            <section id="high-interest-debt">
                <h3>High-Interest Debt</h3>
                <p>High-interest debt generally refers to anything higher than mortgage/student loan interest rates,
                    e.g., credit cards and lines of credit. Credit card (CC) interest rates are ~20% so you should be
                    paying off credit cards each month (don’t spend what you don’t have)! Lines of credit (LOCs) are +-
                    prime rate (bank of canada’s rate), ~7% at the time of writing, which is much lower but still high.
                    You shouldn’t use a LOC as a CC since interest starts accruing immediately, but if you have
                    (overdue) CC debt building up, using a LOC is a good idea if possible. You will NOT find a better
                    investment than a guaranteed 7 to 20+% rate of return by paying off high-interest debt. Aggressively
                    pay off high-interest debt before thinking of investing. Generally, focus on paying off anything >=
                    5% before even thinking of investing (see TLDR Priority Waterfall section for details).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="student-loan-debt">
                <h3>Student Loan Debt</h3>
                <p>I’ll be discussing OSAP, the provincial loan program for Ontario. When you apply for OSAP you're
                    actually getting two loans, one from the NSLSC (federal) and another from OSAP (provincial), but
                    NSLSC manages the loan for both parties (applies to most other provinces). The allocation of each
                    can be found through your NSLSC account. The provincial portion of OSAP has an interest rate of
                    prime rate (set by the Bank of Canada) + 1%, and the federal portion has a 0% interest rate. Your
                    priority is to first pay off OSAP, a cheque accompanied by a letter can be mailed to NSLSC to pay
                    off specifically the OSAP portion. I’ve created a template that you can use here. Some provinces do
                    not have interest on the provincial portion (e.g., BC) so this may not apply depending on where you
                    live. Most other provinces allow you to pay the provincial portion online (not Ontario).</p>
                <p>After that it's a 0% interest loan, pay the minimum! There is no rush to pay it off since it will
                    only get “cheaper” due to inflation. If you’re planning to get a large loan, e.g., a mortgage, talk
                    to a broker, but a 0% interest loan will likely not affect your application/approval amount (meaning
                    you don’t need to pay it off before getting a mortgage).</p>
                <p>An option to maximize money saved and invested is extending the loan’s repayment period. However, 0%
                    interest could be removed by another (likely conservative) government, so I am not giving a
                    recommendation to do this, but it is an option. The default loan repayment period is 9.5 years (at
                    the time of writing). You can increase your payment period to up to 14 years (decreasing monthly
                    payments by ~50%), which saves you money via inflation while also letting you store that money in
                    HISAs (high-interest savings accounts) for lump sum payments (or whatever else you do with money).

            <section id="types-of-accounts">
                <h3>Types of Accounts</h3>
                <p>There are two types of investment accounts: unregistered and registered accounts. Registered accounts
                    (e.g., TFSA), despite having “savings account” in the name are NOT savings accounts in and of
                    themselves. They are only “boxes” for investments to reside in and will not give you interest like a
                    savings account at your local bank will. Investments receive some sort of benefit from being in a
                    particular “box”. There are a few different registered accounts available: TFSA (for general use),
                    RRSP (primarily for retirement), FHSA (for first home), RESP (for your children), and RDSP (relevant
                    if you have a disability). Unregistered accounts, you put money in and get taxed on capital gains.
                </p>
                <p>Any losses within a registered account are not tax deductible against future capital gains, just as
                    capital gains are not taxed. Losses within non-registered accounts are tax deductible against future

                <h3>What is a TFSA?</h3>
                <p>TFSA stands for Tax-Free (Investment) Savings Account. You start accruing TFSA contribution room at
                    18 years old, increasing annually by x amount (indexed to inflation). Money that goes in is “taxed”
                    (presumably as income), while money that comes out is untaxed. There are no taxes, fees, or
                    paperwork to deposit into or withdraw from a TFSA. It is a favourite account for general investing
                    since there are no restrictions on what you can do with the withdrawn funds.</p>
                <p>Your contribution room can be viewed on your CRA account. Your contribution room amount is for Jan
                    1st of the current year, but it won’t be accurate until ~April since companies need to report your
                    TFSA activity for the previous year (by the end of Feb) to the CRA first. To figure out your current
                    contribution room If you’ve made deposits this year you’ll need to deduct your deposits from your
                    starting limit (Jan 1st from the CRA), otherwise just use the CRA’s number.</p>
                <p>If you withdraw you don't lose your contribution room permanently, you gain it back in the following
                    year. Let's say it’s Nov 1st, your current contribution room is $10,000 (meaning you can still
                    deposit $10,000 more into your TFSA), and you withdraw $20,000. Come Jan 1st your contribution room
                    will be $10,000 + $20,000 + the annual increase. You cannot put that $20,000 back into your TFSA
                    until Jan 1st because your contribution room is only re-added at the start of each year. Anything
                    that happens inside your TFSA, e.g., stock gains, dividends, interest, etc. does not count as a
                    deposit (detract from your contribution room).</p>
                <p>This is a little in the weeds, but it is helpful to know how contribution room works. Contribution
                    room can be divided into 2 types, “principal” and “change”, the principal is what is given to you
                    (annually) by the government, and change is based on what you do with the principal. Change can be
                    positive or negative (build upon or detract from your principal contribution room), let's say within
                    your TFSA you gamble on a stock and lose $10,000 and withdraw the remainder, your total contribution
                    room decreases “permanently” by $10,000 (principal + change = principal - $10,000). The same is true
                    for gains if you gain $10,000 while investing and withdraw, your contribution room is “permanently”
                    increased by $10,000 (principal + change = principal + $10,000). In the loss case it means you will
                    not get that $10,000 contribution room back (but you’ll still get back what you withdrew) on Jan
                    1st, while in the second case, you gain $10,000 contribution room (on top of the “principal” you get
                    back) on Jan 1st.</p>

                <h3>What is a RRSP?</h3>
                <p>RRSP stands for Registered Retirement (Investment) Savings Plan. It has the same basic components as
                    a TFSA, e.g., contribution limit, annual increases, etc. but has some key differences. Money that
                    goes in is tax deductible (i.e. deposit $1000, your taxable income is lowered by $1000), while money
                    that comes out is taxed. It allows you to defer paying taxes on deposited income until retirement
                    (when you’ll probably be in a lower tax bracket). There are additional taxes, fees, and paperwork to
                    withdraw from an RRSP so it is only recommended to withdraw using one of the RRSP programs (HBP or
                    LLP), or as a last resort (e.g., going homeless). It is a great account for saving for retirement (+
                    some programs) since it lets you save more money on taxes up front to increase long-term
                    investments.</p>
                <p>Your RRSP contribution room increases next period by 18% of your previous year’s income (up to
                    $31,560 for 2023, annual caps). Generally, RRSP contribution room should be saved for your higher
                    income years (but generally just follow TLDR Priority Waterfall) to lower income tax at higher tax
                    brackets. It isn’t recommended to invest in an RRSP (beyond RRSP matching) if you believe you’ll
                    have a higher taxed income during retirement than right now (e.g., you’re usually paid 100k but take
                    a break year, you probably shouldn’t into an RRSP during that break year). Unlike a TFSA which has
                    periods of Jan 1st - Dec 31st, RRSPs have periods of ~March 2nd - March 1st (the following year),
                    exact periods can be found <a
                        href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/contributing-a-rrsp-prpp-dpsp/contributions-rrsp.html">here</a>.
                    If you withdraw from an RRSP (except using HBP or LLP), you will permanently lose the contribution
                    room.</p>
                <p>Companies typically RRSP match 3-6% of your annual salary. You should be contributing the maximum
                    RRSP matching your company offers, it is an instant 100% return on investment. Company RRSP matching
                    is income for tax purposes (included on T4), but your RRSP contribution is tax deductible (so it
                    evens out if the matching is 1:1). Company investment options vary, so it is a good idea to
                    understand what options your company offers.</p>
                <p>RRSPs have a couple of different programs, one being the Home Buyer’s Program (HBP), which allows
                    people to withdraw from their RRSPs up to $35,000 to buy a home. The withdrawn amount has to be
                    repaid to your RRSP within 17 years. You’ll have to pay at least 1/15 of what you borrowed each
                    year, starting in 2 years (i.e. buy a home in 2022, you’ll have to repay at least 1/15 each year
                    starting in 2024). If your RRSP is with your company some of it might not be accessible for HBP (can
                    withdraw from GRSP but not DPSP).</p>
                <p>The other program is the Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP), which allows people to withdraw from their
                    RRSPs up to $10,000 a calendar year and up to $20,000 for participation in a qualifying educational
                    program. The withdrawn amount has to be repaid to your RRSP within 10 years. If your RRSP is with
                    your company some of it might not be accessible for the LLP (can withdraw from GRSP but not DPSP).
                </p>
                <p>In case it isn’t clear enough, your contribution room limit must not be exceeded by the sum of your
                    (and employer's) contributions to your RRSP/GRSP/DPSP (since they are all RRSPs). Employer-sponsored
                    pensions (not CPP) also count toward (reduce) your RRSP contribution room increase for the following
                    year (it does not affect your current room). The amount isn’t dollar for dollar ($1 pension
                    contribution != $1 of RRSP contribution room lost/used). The amount of RRSP contribution room lost
                    the following year is called a pension adjustment, it will be detailed on your T4.</p>
                <p>Random notes feel free to skip, just a heads-up that certain things exist. Spousal RRSPs exist and
                    are worth looking into if you’re married or in a common-law relationship. There are loans called
                    RRSP loans, uncommon, but can help maximize RRSP returns if you don’t have the funds at the time to
                    max out your RRSP (with the intention of then using the RRSP tax refund to pay down the loan). These
                    are generally done (if at all) in your high-income years, they make sense in certain situations.
                    RRSPs do have certain cross-border benefits, e.g., U.S. dividends are not subject to withholding tax
                    when the investment is within an RRSP (since the U.S. recognizes the RRSP).</p>

                <h4>What is a GRSP?</h4>
                <p>GRSP stands for Group RRSP. It’s almost identical to a normal RRSP, but there are some differences.
                    Your investment is deposited pre-tax directly from your employer (so you don’t have to wait for tax
                    refund season to get that money back hurray), ranges from slightly higher to significantly higher
                    fees than self-managing, and “locks in” funds until retirement (can still be used for HBP or LLP).
                    It is a no-brainer to participate if your company offers RRSP matching.</p>

                <h4>What is a DPSP?</h4>
                <p>DPSP stands for Deferred Profit Sharing Plan, it’s a type of RRSP (and is an RRSP for contribution
                    room, tax purposes, etc.). Some companies deposit their RRSP matching into a DPSP instead of a GRSP
                    (GRSP holds your RRSP contribution).</p>

                <p>It looks like an RRSP, and it quacks like an RRSP, but there’s a catch, a vesting period (legal
                    maximum of 2 years). This means you may lose most or all of the company’s RRSP matching if you leave
                    a company before the vesting period (you will not lose your personal contributions). You should talk
                    to HR within the first month to gain a better understanding of your company’s plan. If you leave
                    before vesting you do not permanently lose the RRSP contribution room, but there is paperwork needed
                    to regain it, as well as retroactively reducing your past income because of the DPSP clawback.</p>

                <p>Whether or not you decide to do RRSP matching with vesting depends on a couple of factors. Most
                    importantly, do you plan to leave before the vesting period (if there is one)? Most likely if you
                    leave before the vesting period all matching will be forfeited but if a better opportunity comes up,
                    a RRSP matching vesting period is not a strong reason to pass it up. It is still a good idea to do
                    RRSP matching in case you do stay for the vesting period.</p>

                <h4>What is a RRIF?</h4>
                <p>RRIF stands for Registered Retirement Income Fund. You are required to convert your RRSPs into RRIFs
                    at 71. It’s basically an RRSP, except you can no longer contribute to it. There is a $2,000 tax
                    credit you can get at >= 65 years old if you’re withdrawing from an RRIF (not applicable to RRSPs).
                    Institutions also usually charge withdrawal fees for RRSPs while RRIFs do not (to dissuade
                    withdrawing from RRSPs before retirement). You’d want to convert to an RRIF if you’re (permanently)
                    retiring to avoid withdrawal fees and gain the $2000 tax credit (if >= 65 years old).</p>

                <p>There are some government retirement income options (CPP, OAS, GIS) that I won’t be discussing since
                    so much could change by the time you can access these (60 at the earliest).</p>

            <section id="fhsa">
                <h3>What is a FHSA?</h3>
                <p>FHSA stands for First Home Savings Account. It mixes the best parts of a TFSA and RRSP, withdrawals
                    are tax-free (for home buying) like a TFSA, while contributions are tax-deductible like an RRSP.
                    There is currently an $8,000/year contribution limit, with a $40,000 lifetime maximum (at the time
                    of writing), you can only have $16,000 of contribution room at a given time (from carrying forward
                    room). You’re considered a first-time home buyer if you’re a Canadian aged 18 - 71 who hasn’t lived
                    in a home that you or your spouse owned in the last four years (and aren’t buying an investment
                    property).</p>

                <p>It is pretty sweet, the only downside is you have a 15-year time limit to buy a home from when you
                    open it* or else your FHSA converts to an RRSP (still a registered account but worse than a FHSA).
                    This is why I recommend opening an FHSA when you’re sure you’re going to purchase a home within at
                    least 10 years (otherwise skip investing in FHSA for now). Prioritize FHSA over a TFSA only if
                    you’re going to purchase within 6 years, this is because like an RRSP you want to save the FHSA tax
                    deduction for your highest income years (presumably you’ll be making more as time goes on/as you get
                    closer to buying a home).</p>

                <p>If you believe you’re going to buy a home soon (&lt;= 6 years), but don’t currently have the funds to
                    open a FHSA and max out your $8k annual contribution limit, you should still open it. If you open
                    your FHSA and deposit something (let's say $100, you need to deposit to get contribution room) you
                    can carry forward the rest. This means next year you can deposit $15,900 ($8000 + $7900), so you can
                    max it out next year (there is a $16,000 annual cap so you can’t keep carrying forward room).</p>

            <section id="resp">
                <h3>What is a RESP?</h3>
                <p>RESP stands for Registered Education Savings Plan. Anyone can set up an RESP for a child (< 18 years
                        old), even a stranger (with the info needed), but I’m assuming you’d like to set up an RESP for
                        your child. There are extra benefits for lower-income earners, which I won’t be discussing, but
                        is detailed <a href="#">here</a>. It is to help pay for your child’s post-secondary education,
                        e.g., tuition, accommodation, supplies, etc.</p>

                <p>The main benefit of an RESP is that the government will match 20% of your contributions (annual cap
                    of $2500), it is an instant 20% return on investment. That means you can contribute up to $2500 and
                    receive up to $500 (20%) in CESG (grant) matching annually. You can contribute more than $2500 per
                    year, but you won’t receive matching (no incentive to). There is a $7200 lifetime limit for
                    government contributions. Officially you have to track CESG matching yourself to make sure the
                    government doesn’t contribute over the lifetime limit.</p>

                <p>In an ideal world, you’d open an RESP for your child when they’re born (and have a SIN) and
                    contribute $2500 annually to receive the maximum 20% matching for 15 years (in the 15th year you can
                    contribute $1,000 since you’ll hit the lifetime matching limit). Life gets in the way though, if you
                    open an RESP late they’ll still be able to receive some benefit, if they’re still < 16 years old
                        it’s not too late to start! There are limitations around matching after the age of 15.</p>

                        <p>Withdrawals are divided into: Post-Secondary Education (PSE) and Education Assistance Payment
                            (EAP). PSEs are withdrawals of creator-deposited funds, these are not taxed. EAPs are
                            withdrawals of government-contributed funds (including investment growth of the matching),
                            it is taxed (as the student’s income), but they likely won’t have much income being a
                            student. EAP withdrawals are limited to $8,000 for full-time students and $4,000 for
                            part-time students during the first 13 weeks of schooling, past 13 weeks there is no limit.
                        </p>

                        <p>If your child doesn’t go into post-secondary there are 4 options: keeping the RESP open for
                            if they do so in the future, replace the beneficiary (student), transferring the money to
                            other registered savings plans (RRSP, RDSP, or RESPs), or close the RESP. If the funds
                            aren’t used for educational purposes the CESG (grants) will likely have to be returned to
                            the government. More details can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

                    great pension plans are PSPP, HOOPP, OTPP, and OMERS.</p>
                <p>Employer-sponsored pension plans also count toward your RRSP contribution room increase the following
                    year (it does not affect your current room). The amount isn’t 1-to-1 ($1 pension contribution != $1
                    of RRSP contribution room lost). The amount of RRSP contribution room lost the following year is
                    called a pension adjustment, it will be detailed on your T4.</p>
                <p>Typically if you leave a job with a pension plan you have a few options: cash out (taxed), transfer
                    it to a new plan (if your new employer has one, might have to be cashed out to do that), transfer it
                    to an RRSP/LIRA, or keep it in the existing pension plan.</p>

                    or GICs instead of bonds. Mutual funds generally perform equal to or worse than market-following
                    ETFs (before fees) while charging a significantly higher fee (~1-3% vs. &lt; 1% fees of ETFs or
                    Roboadvisors), just choose a (good) ETF or Robo-advisor.</p>

                    are a common investment for Canadians, I’m not going to discuss it since it’s a whole other can of
                    worms. It cannot go into an investment account.</p>
                <p>In a normal real estate market it takes 5 years to break even (taking into account realtor fees,
                    taxes, etc.), so if your ownership expectation is shorter than 5 years it may be better to rent.</p>

                <h3>High-Interest Savings Accounts (HISAs)</h3>
                <p>You’re probably familiar with HISAs, they typically offer higher rates than regular savings accounts.
                    Are very liquid as you can the funds at any time you’d like. Most big banks (e.g., TD) usually give
                    garbage HISA rates with minimum required deposits and steep transaction fees. It’s impossible to
                    suggest anything as rates can change at any time, but a popular HISA bank is Tangerine. I personally
                    am using WS Cash (4% at the time of writing). HISAs are great accounts if you are unsure when you’ll
                    need to withdraw (e.g., while window car shopping).</p>

            <section id="gics">
                <h3>Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs)</h3>
                <p>If your investment timeline is &lt; 5 years, something erring on the side of caution is better. GICs
                    generally have higher rates than HISAs, but the funds will be locked for months - years (depending
                    on the duration you pick). GIC rates vary based on the Bank of Canada’s interest rate, so there is
                    quite a lot of variance. As the name implies though the investment is guaranteed (up to the CDIC
                    limit), so there is no risk to your investment. GICs are likely the best choice if you’ll need the
                    funds within 5 years, but not in the very near future/at a moment’s notice. Rates change so it’s
                    best to just search up “X month/year GIC” to get up-to-date info. All interest rates are annually
                    (per annum), so, e.g., if you get a 90-day GIC at 4%, you won’t have 4% more at the end of the 90
                    days.</p>

                <h3>Stocks (Equity)</h3>
                <p>A stock is a share of a company, e.g., if you own 1 share of a company that has 100 shares, you own
                    1% of the company. Many factors affect how a stock performs, no one can guarantee you that a single
                    stock will perform well. I’m not a fan of investing in individual stocks as personally it can be
                    quite time-consuming, and has more inherent risk. It is not a good idea to put all your eggs in one
                    basket, putting everything into one stock is essentially gambling. With any equity investment, it is
                    entirely possible to lose everything you invest. Stock picking is an option for an avid investor,
                    but I can’t recommend it.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="etfs">
                <h3>Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</h3>
                <p>ETFs are investment funds that generally follow some sort of index or market (e.g., the S&P 500,
                    Canadian bonds, etc.). ETFs are passive investments, usually not trying to beat the market by stock
                    picking, but instead attempting to follow the market. Most mutual funds lose vs. the market long
                    term, so the odds of individual investors (like us) are slim. It is very difficult to consistently
                    beat the market over the long run, that’s why (good) ETFs are recommended. ETFs are quite passive,
                    the ETF provider will rebalance investments so you don’t have to. Good ETFs are some of the
                    lowest-fee investments (usually &lt; 0.25% MER). Good ETFs also diversify your portfolio by bundling
                    companies together, spreading out your investment (rather than just a single stock), generally
                    making them safer and less volatile.</p>

                <p>The ETFs I’ll be discussing later are asset allocation ETFs (that try to follow the global economy)
                    with some ratio of bonds, the ratio between equity (stocks) and fixed-income (bonds) is called asset
                    allocation. For example, an ETF with a 90-10 asset allocation invests 90% in equity (stocks) and 10%
                    in fixed-income (bonds). ETFs with a 100-0 or 80-20 split are considered growth ETFs, with more
                    relative risk (but still a lot less risky than individual stocks) and higher potential rewards and
                    losses. ETFs with a 60-40 or 40-60 split are considered balanced (split somewhat evenly between
                    stocks and bonds), with less relative risk and less potential rewards. ETFs with a 20-80 or 0-100
                    split are considered conservative (heavily leaning toward bonds), lower risk and lower potential
                    rewards. If you’re considering conservative ETFs, I recommend just sticking with GICs since the
                    risk-to-reward ratio compared to GICs makes them unattractive. Good market-following ETFs are all
                    about minimizing risk while maximizing potential growth, but it is important to note there is always
                    an inherent risk with equity.</p>

                <p>Vanguard has a great quiz to help you decide on which asset allocation is correct for you, based on
                    time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial knowledge. I recommend taking it to help you decide on
                    an asset allocation (if applicable) here.</p>

            <section id="robo-advisors">
                <h3>Robo-advisors</h3>
                <p>Robo-advisors are algorithms to auto-invest and rebalance your portfolio, charging relatively low
                    fees (Robo-advisors tend to be around 0.5% MER). Robo-advisors are similar to ETFs, mostly because
                    they invest in ETFs. The difference is that Robo-advisors will automatically invest the money you
                    put in, and you will have to customize your portfolio to some ratio of equity (stocks) to
                    fixed-income (bonds). Robo-advisors tend to be conservative so you’ll have to manually set it to the
                    risk profile you’d prefer (especially if your goal is long-term growth). Robo-advisors are fine if
                    you don’t like to be hands-on at all, but I strongly recommend (good) ETFs since they really are a
                    similar amount of work (just getting them set up is most of the work done), for lower fees (~<0.24%
                        vs. ~0.5%).</p>

            <section id="what-to-invest-in">
                <h3>What to Invest in?</h3>
                <p>Before investing you have to ask yourself some questions. What is your risk tolerance? What is your
                    time horizon (when will you need the funds)? Will you hold (and keep buying) an ETF if, e.g., it
                    dropped 40% tomorrow? Again, Vanguard has a great quiz to help you decide which asset allocation to
                    choose. I recommend taking it to help you get a general idea of which asset allocation is right for
                    you here (note it doesn’t give non-asset allocation recommendations).</p>
                <p>If your investment timeline is &lt; 5 years (e.g., for a house downpayment or a car), stick with
                    HISAs and GICs. Pick HISAs over GICs when you’re unsure how soon you will need it (e.g., actively
                    bidding on homes). Balanced ETFs are an option if fits your risk tolerance.</p>
                <p>If your investment timeline is &gt; 5 years but &lt; 10 years it gets a little tricky. Historically
                    even at the worst of times stock markets tend to recover within 10 years. If you’re very risk-averse
                    I recommend sticking with GICs. If you can accept some risk for rewards, with the potential of a
                    loss I recommend balanced ETFs (60-40 or 40-60 splits). If you are willing to accept a higher amount
                    of risk growth ETFs (100-0 or 80-20 splits) are an option, but not for everyone. Refer to the “Need
                    financial help?” section for how to find guidance. All equity investments, even ETFs that are spread
                    across thousands of companies globally, have inherent risk. It is important to note that returns are
                    never guaranteed (for equity investments).</p>
                <p>If your investment timeline is > 10 years I recommend growth ETFs (100-0 or 80-20 splits). If you
                    have a lower risk appetite balanced ETFs are an option. If you are very risk averse GICs exist, but
                    it is likely to be a too-conservative option (but better if you’re prone to panic selling). An often
                    overlooked risk with being too safe is not being able to reach your financial goals, while there is
                    risk in investing in equity, investing in GICs long-term puts you at risk of not reaching your
                    long-term goals, e.g., retirement (but they are great for funds needed “soon”).
                </p>
                <p>For any investment timeline I mention, the preferential options laid out are only good if you are
                    willing to stick to the plan (i.e. not panic sell if there’s a sudden drop and keep purchasing). Be
                    sure to read the “Investment Strategies” and “Common Mistakes” sections before committing to a
                    certain investment.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that MERs are a percentage of your total portfolio (e.g., 2% MER = $200 fee for
                    $10,000 investment), not just growth. This is why low-fee ETFs are so popular, you can get similar
                    or better returns with lower fees than mutual funds. Note that fees are usually skimmed off your
                    investment automatically, not manually paid.</p>

                    are your options?
                    I’ll be discussing offerings from three companies: Vanguard, BlackRock and BMO; Vanguard and
                    BlackRock are the 2 largest index fund providers in the world and are both highly regarded within
                    the industry, and BMO you’re probably familiar with.

                <p>
                    I am omitting conservative ETFs (20-80 and 0-100) since I recommend GICs or balanced ETFs over them
                    (situation-dependent).
                    These are all relatively safe investments (compared to some other ETFs and individual stocks) as
                    these are all globally diversified (spread-out eggs).
                    VEQT for instance spreads its investments over 13,619 companies globally however these lean toward
                    the U.S. market since it is the largest (the holdings of an ETF can be found on the companies'
                    websites).
                    There are small differences between all of them, but not enough for me to talk about (Vanguard and
                    BlackRock are more popular).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A common long-term investing path is VEQT or XEQT (coin flip, pick whatever letter you like best if
                    you want), investing monthly, set and forget, and maybe checking in once a year (make sure to turn
                    on 2FA).
                    If you’re not sure what to do with a > 10-year time frame, I suggest referring to the “Need
                    financial help?” section for guidance on how to find guidance.
                    I chose these 3 index providers since they are the largest/most trusted globally. These specific
                    ETFs are also globally diversified vs. most other ETFs, e.g., VFV (by Vanguard) only tracks the S&P
                    500 (the largest 500 companies on the U.S. stock exchange).
                    Which could perform better or worse, but is less diversified (exposed only to the U.S.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a defined benefit pension that typically counts as bonds in allocation (meaning you can
                    and probably should be leaning toward higher returning investments (100-0, 80-20).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ll stop short of any recommendations in any particular ETF since there aren’t huge differences
                    between the ones I mentioned at the same asset allocation, but I will tell you what I am personally
                    invested in, and you can take from that what you will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my TFSA I am invested in VFV, purely speculation on my part on how the US market will fair
                    against the global market over the next 10 years (based on factors like exchange rate, economic
                    recovery times, forecasted worker productivity blah blah blah).
                    In my RRSP (company matching) I am mirroring VEQT (you can usually mirror the underlying holdings if
                    VEQT isn’t directly an option with whatever company you’re with, e.g., VEQT holds ~45% U.S. market,
                    ~30% CAN market, ~25% international market).
                    I am willing to be riskier with my TFSA (only U.S. exposure) than my RRSP (globally diversified) due
                    to my own risk tolerance and what they’re intended for.
                    I am not investing in FHSA since I’m unsure if I’ll be in Canada in the medium-long term. I am not
                    recommending mirroring what I’m doing, just sharing for transparency and context.

                    needed for the stock). Questrade is better if you’d like to trade in USD. I personally use
                    Wealthsimple Trade for what I mentioned, and it has a cleaner/friendlier interface. I also don’t
                    intend to trade U.S. stocks (popular U.S. indexes have some CAD equivalent) because of currency
                    exchange fees. BMO also allows for $0 fee trading on the ETFs I mentioned but doesn’t have it for
                    all stocks/ETFs.</p>

                <h3>Investing Strategy</h3>
                <p>It is important to set clear goals of what you’ll need the funds for, e.g., a home, building wealth,
                    etc. so you can choose what investment option is most appropriate for you.</p>
                <p>Have a plan and invest regularly (e.g., monthly), even if your (good) investment is dropping, this is
                    called dollar cost averaging, and it reduces market timing risk. Patience is a virtue, make a good
                    plan and stick to it, and think long-term. Adjust your plan based on your financial situation or
                    goals as needed. Refer to the “Need financial help?” section if needed.</p>
                <p>If you have a larger sum of money you’d like to invest, you could spread it out over a few months (to
                    reduce timing risk). In general, though, time in the market beats dollar cost averaging ⅔ times
                    (which is why some people max out their TFSAs and dump it into ETFs every January rather than
                    spreading it out over the year).</p>

                <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
                <p>The most important common mistake is deviating from a (solid) plan, e.g., impulsively selling if
                    there is a drop. Stick with a solid plan through the good and bad, hopefully, you’ve made a good
                    plan by reading this guide (or talking to a fee-only financial advisor).</p>
                <p>Other common mistakes are trying to time the market, impulse buying and selling, lack of
                    patience/changing plans too often, and overestimating risk tolerance. Chasing past returns, just
                    because something performed well in the past does not mean it will perform in the future. And under
                    estimating risk tolerance for long-term investments, e.g., if your timeline is > 30 years for
                    retirement you’ll likely be losing a lot of potential returns if you invested in GICs or bonds,
                    making it more difficult to reach your retirement goals.</p>

                <h4>Oscar the server.</h4>
                <p>
                    Oscar, 26, lives at home and has a full-time job as a server, he makes 60k a year.
                    His company doesn’t offer RRSP matching, and he doesn’t have any student loans.
                    He spent a few years making reckless financial decisions (spending what money he didn’t have on
                    vacations, a luxury car, etc.) but is hoping to learn and do better now.
                    He has 30k in credit card debt (20% interest), 10k left on a car loan (6%), and 5k on a line of
                    credit (8%, 15k line of credit).
                    Note that a consumer proposal/bankruptcy makes sense in some situations (not this one), but that is
                    outside of the scope of this guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily he has a good amount of available income since he lives at home.
                    His first priority is paying off his high-interest debt, he cuts costs, hunts for grocery deals, and
                    buys the essentials.
                    He immediately uses 10k from his line of credit (he currently is using 5k/15k of his line of credit)
                    toward his CC debt (since the LOC interest is much lower than the CC interest).
                    Then starts paying using all available funds (while still making minimum payments) to aggressively
                    pay off high-interest debt in order of interest (CC -> LOC -> car loan).
                    Once he is done paying off high-interest debt he can build a rainy day fund before thinking of
                    investing.

                <h4>Max the civil engineer.</h4>
                <p>
                    Max, 25, lives in a 2 bedroom with a roommate and has a full-time job as a civil engineer, he makes
                    80k a year.
                    He takes public transit to work and doesn’t need any time soon, his education was paid for by his
                    parents so he has no student loan debt.
                    He’s been able to save well while working part-time through university.
                    Max has already been taking advantage of his company’s 4% RRSP matching, and he has just maxed out
                    his TFSA (with balanced ETFs with home ownership in mind).
                    Max’s goal is to own a home in 5 years when he is 30. He has an investment budget of $1000/mo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Max is buying within 6 years, he opens and prioritizes his FHSA, contributing the max amount
                    of $8k annually for 5 years ($40k lifetime limit), since the timeline is short he invests it into
                    GICs (inside his FHSA).
                    Putting the remaining investment budget into GICs in his TFSA (when he gets more contribution room
                    each year). After 5 years he decides to buy a condo.
                    He pulls 75k from his TFSA, 40k + GIC growth from his FHSA, and uses the RRSP’s HBP to withdraw 35k
                    from his company’s RRSP (usually a GRSP).
                    He has ~153k for his down payment and purchases a condo.

            <section id="financial-help">
                <h3>Need financial help?</h3>
                <p>
                    TLDR; if you need frequent financial advice or have absolutely 0 interest in finances (and are
                    willing to accept the cost), a fee financial advisor is okay (but still not recommended).
                    If you are looking to make a comprehensive plan go with a fee-only financial advisor +
                    ETFs/GICs/HISAs.
                    If you don't need financial advice or are willing to self-study, ETFs are a great way to maximize
                    returns with lower fees over the long term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need financial help, it is recommended to talk to a fee-only financial planner. This is
                    because financial advisors are not legally required to be fiduciaries (people legally obligated to
                    have your best interests in mind), and are often incentivized to steer you toward investments that
                    give them larger commissions (which is avoided with fee-only financial planners).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you need a financial advisor though? It depends on why you need one, if you're looking to get
                    your finances in order and make a comprehensive financial plan for your future (e.g., planning for
                    financial timelines for saving for retirement, house, kids, etc.) or need frequent financial help,
                    it can be a fine option.
                    That is to say, if you feel your financial situation is too complicated to handle (tax planning,
                    estate planning, the best way to draw down your investments in retirement, etc.) they are a solid
                    option. If you just wanted help picking ETFs for while you’re saving for a house, it really isn’t
                    needed to talk to one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why I try to edge people away from non-fee-only financial advisors is that they are
                    salespeople, they might push you toward investments that net them higher fees/bonuses, push you
                    towards life insurance (when you don't need it), etc. In most provinces there are NO requirements to
                    be called a financial advisor, I can call myself a financial advisor with no repercussions.
                    If you're looking at a non-fee-only financial advisor the minimum I recommend is that you ask if
                    they are a fiduciary (legally obligated to act in your best interest), if they aren't, they are
                    under no obligation to prioritize you over themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you'd like a financial advisor I recommend a fee-only financial advisor when you're ready to make
                    a comprehensive financial plan (~$2000 for ~6 hours to make a comprehensive plan that fits your
                    financial goals and risk profile, it might seem steep but it is a bargain compared to non-fee-only
                    advisors). You are also much more likely to get unbiased and objective investment advice since you
                    are paying them for their time directly (rather than through investments).
                    <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZ5L29ncKZVoiI9ZlOSOnxZmG46Bko9MfN2f5Wj5zDk/edit#gid=0">Here's
                        a spreadsheet (not mine) of fee-only financial planners link</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assuming you don't have &gt; $1 million in liquid assets I recommend spending some time
                    independently
                    learning about finances over having a financial advisor. The median fee for financial advisors is 1%
                    (usually higher if it’s a smaller portfolio), this is on total assets, not just on growth.
                    <a
                        href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/financial-toolkit/questions-adviser.html">Here's
                        a list of questions to ask a financial advisor from the government link</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example let's say your financial advisor is able to at least match the market (though it is
                    statistically likely they will perform worse than the market). You're planning for retirement in 30
                    years, you start with $50,000 and can invest $1500/mo until you retire. You get an annual return of
                    6.6% (the 50-year average of the S&P 500 taking inflation into account). You're investing in a
                    low-cost market ETF (0.20% MER) or with a financial advisor (1.00% MER).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No Fees: end with $2,052,000 ($0 in fees)</li>
                    <li>Scenario 1 (ETF): end with $1,967,000 ($85,000 in fees), ~4% loss</li>
                    <li>Scenario 2 (advisor): end with $1,664,000 ($388,000 in fees), ~19% loss</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Going with a financial advisor, even assuming they match the market over the next 30 years you'll
                    lose $303,000 (that’s bonkers!) in fees compared to a low-cost market ETF. You’d pay ~5x more in
                    fees with the financial advisor. Your financial advisor would have to outperform the market to net
                    you the same return as the ETF option. Even mutual funds (that manage much more money than the
                    typical financial advisor) underperform vs. the market even in the short term. E.g., for large-cap
                    funds vs. the S&P 500, 74% of funds underperformed vs. the S&P 500 after 3 years, and 93% after 15
                    years.
                    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/active-managers-still-failing-beat-sp-500/">(source)</a>.
                    It is highly probable that your local financial advisor will perform worse than that.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Wow, you made it, and I am happy you did! I hope the memes kept you awake. It really pays to put in
                    a few hours to research and understand all the options available to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This pretty much sums up how you should invest in a low-stress, fiscally responsible manner (based
                    on your own risk tolerance, timeline, etc.). The largest exclusion though is how much you should be
                    investing, on purpose, because it is very situation-dependent. It varies so much that it really
                    should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Generally, at least 15% of gross (pre-tax income) is
                    recommended (20% is a better minimum), more if you’re starting relatively late (30+ years old),
                    buying a home and paying a mortgage instead counts as part of the % toward savings (since you’re
                    investing in a home). That sounds like a lot to set aside, but, e.g., if you have 5% RRSP matching,
                    you’re already saving 10% (5% you + 5% employer)!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Investing for the future is great and all, and you should be keeping your future in mind, but don’t
                    forget to live life. Take that vacation, rent your own place, and go buy your dream Ferrari (ok
                    maybe not this one). Excited for what the future holds for all of you :)
